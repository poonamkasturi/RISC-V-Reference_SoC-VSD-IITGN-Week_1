# 🌟 RISC-V Reference SoC Tapeout Program - Week 1 🚀 
### A hands-on journey into Verilog RTL design, simulation, and synthesis using open-source tools.


Welcome to **Week 1** of the [RISC-V Reference SoC Tapeout Program](https://www.vlsisystemdesign.com/soc-labs/) by **VSD** and **IITGN** — a national initiative to turn India’s semiconductor vision into reality.

https://github.com/kunalg123/sky130RTLDesignAndSynthesisWorkshop

This 20-week program guides participants from RTL design to actual silicon tapeout. 

Week 1 lays the foundation with Real-world design flow from RTL to gate-level netlist using open-source tools.
